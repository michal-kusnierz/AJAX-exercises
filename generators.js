/*
Generator Objects have a return() method that terminates the Generator function. 
Return() causes a return statement to be performed at the most recent yield statement. 
The return() method takes in one optional variable that is used as the return value 
of the Generator function. 
Calling return(x) will return an object with a value property equal to x 
and a done property of true. 
After return() is called, subsequent yield statements in the Generator function are ignored.
